Nakalele Blowhole#21.024589#-156.590724#5#We are comming up on the Nakele Blowhole parking area.  A blowhole is hole in the ground that connects to an underground, partially submerged ocean cave. The cave and opening are shaped in such a way that when the ocean rises or waves crash into it, a jet of water and air is violently forced out through the hole. It is a 1.25 mile hike to the blowhole.  "Acid War Zone" is the name for the area that surrounds the blowhole.it is a barren landscape where boulders have been severely pock-marked, sculpted, perched precariously, and otherwise dramatically eroded by countless years of salt water spray.

Olivine Pools#21.007672#-156.557686#7#Olivine Pools was first popularized by the book Maui Revealed, which gave it the name and put it on the map so to speak.  These tidepools are a good place to go for a dip along the rocky coast of Maui.  Be careful here, the trek to the pools is tough, similar to the blowhole.  If waves are crashing into the pool with any force at all do not enter the pools.  Many people have died here, being swept from the pools into the ocean by particularly large waves.

Whale Watching Lookout#20.775383#-156.536145#10#The name of this lookout observation site is Papawai Point, but it is often mistakenly called McGregor Point, which is the location of the nearby lighthouse.  In the winter, which is whale-watching season, the small parking lot at this lookout point is always crowded with cars.  Whales are usually visible nearby.  At that time of year, there is a naturalist from the Pacific Whale Foundation here most days from 8 AM to 2 PM. They have demonstrations and exhibits about whales.  You can borrow their binoculars and ask them all your questions about whales. At any time of year, the views here are gorgeous.  You look out across Maalaea Bay, and out to the ocean, seeing the islands of Kahoolawe and Molokini.  This is a great place to see the sun rise over Haleakala Volcano.  On a very rare especially clear day, you can even see the Big Island of Hawaii in the distance.
